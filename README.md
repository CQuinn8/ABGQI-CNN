# Code repository for Quinn et al., 2022 <doi> 
This code repository contains R and python scripts that process data and produce results from provided intermediate products for soundscape classification and ecological analyses. This work was funded under the Soundscapes 2 Landscapes, NASAâ€™s Citizen Science for Earth Systems Program 16-CSESP 2016-0009 and is citable using the Zenodo DOI. Note: Please be aware that underlying software, specifically for the CNN implementation, may not continue stability as python libraries are updated.
  
### This repository can: 
  1) generate all code-based figures, tables, and numerical results in the published manuscript.
  2) be used to re-train the ABGQI-CNN
  3) be applied to novel acoustic data by generating 2-s Mel spectrograms, ABGQI-CNN inference probabilities, f-score threshold optimization, and classification based on CNN findings related to Soundscapes 2 Landscapes data

### Installation  
- Two Anaconda python environments are included in .yml files under envs. These provide information related to libraries used in spectrogram generation, CNN training, and inference. 
- R required libraries can be found in the envs R_requirements.txt file. The R_lib_install.R file can be run to install all packages in the requirements text file or you can manually download every package. Options to run the R_lib_installer:
	1) RStudio: open R_lib_install.R, uncomment line 3 and specify path to envs/R_requirements.txt in Git repo.
	2) command line: R_lib_installer.R <envs/R_requirements.txt>
	- Note, warnings are suppressed. If this method results in errors or libs are not installed use "install.packages("<package name>") to manually install.
